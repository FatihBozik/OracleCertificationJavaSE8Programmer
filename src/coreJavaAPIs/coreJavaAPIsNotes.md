## Creating and Manipulating Strings

String name = "Fluffy;
String name =  new String("Fluffy");

## Concatenation 

Placing one String before the other String and combining them together is called string concatenation. 

Three rules about concatenations:

1) If both operands are numeric, + means numeric addition.

2) If either operand is String , Ã¼ means concatenation.

3) The expression is evaluated left to right.

Let's take a look at some examples:

```
System.out.println(1 + 2); // 3
System.out.println("a" + "b"); // ab
System.out.println("a" + "b" + 3); // ab3
System.out.println(1 + 2 + "c"); // 3c
```
