# Operations and Statements

A java operator is a special symbol that can be applied to a set of variables, values or literals--referred to as operands-- and that returns a result. Three flavors of operators are available in Java:

- Unary
- Binary 
- Ternary

|       Post-unary operators      	| expression++, expresion--                      	|
|:-------------------------------:	|------------------------------------------------	|
|       Pre-unary operators       	| ++expression, --expresion                      	|
|      Other unary operators      	| +, -, !                                        	|
| Multiplication/Division/Modulus 	| *, /, %                                        	|
|      Addition/Substraction      	| +, -                                           	|
|         Shift operators         	| <<, >>, >>>                                    	|
|       Relational operators      	| <, >, <=, >=, instanceof                       	|
|      Equal to/not equal to      	| ==, !=                                         	|
|        Logical operators        	| &, ^,                                          	|
|  Short-circuit logcal operators 	| &&,                                            	|
|        Ternary operators        	| boolean expression ? expression1 : expression2 	|
|       Assignment operators      	| =, +=, -=, ...                                 	|
